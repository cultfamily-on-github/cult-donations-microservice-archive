# CULT & RVLT Donations Microservice

People who create value shall be rewarded. 

This microservice represents a system where people who create value are rewarded via direct donations.  

People who donate to others are also rewarded as their generosity is also a value within the CULT Donations System.

People can create value by: 
1. Providing Education Services like Online Coaching Videos around topics like decentralization, self hosted wallets etc.  
2. Programming corresponding services  
3. Donating to people who deserve it  

Reminder: Create Diagram to describe the incentive structure in detail.



## Goals
1. Incentivize value creation   
2. Increase number of CULT & RVLT holders

## How it Works

Whenever someone perceives the work results of someone else as valuable, he is invited to donate directly to the one who created the valuable work results.  

Whenever someone perceives a donation as valuable and reasonable, he is invited to donate to the one who triggered the donation. 

[cultdonations.org](https://cultdonations.org) (under construction) is a place where people can register their wallet address, their linkedin or facebook profile link and their work results to become potential donation receivers. 

Potential donators can check if the owner of the linkedin or facebook profile is actively and consistently providing value for the CULT - e.g. by educating facebook friends or linkedin contacts around the CULTDAO... - If he does, chances are high that donators will donate to this wallet.

To incentivice this game for donators their donations are listed on [cultdonations.org](https://cultdonations.org) (under construction) as acts of generosity which will again inspire big wallets to donate to those who donate reasonably to other value creators.   

## GitCoin & Quadratic Funding
On the long run some big money might also come from [gitcoin grants](https://gitcoin.co/grants). One goal of the CULT & RVLT Donations Microservice is to make [gitcoin grants](https://gitcoin.co/grants) and [quadratic funding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEHv-dE4xl8) much more accessible for newcomers who want to add value / public goods. 

Our power is massive when we collaborate. 

## Infos for Programmers

In order to strengthen resilience, scalability and technological freedom for contributors, we establish a microservices architecture. 

You might contribute to explore and improve architectures of freedom.

## Status
First Drafts & Idea Collection

## Frontend
When it comes to state of the art web programming frameworks [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) is the framework [of choice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv3Yq-B8qp4) imo.    
The two main reasons for that choice - comparing svelte to angular, vue and react - are performance and simplicity.   
You might continuously improve the performance of this page utilizing [pagespeed.web.dev](https://pagespeed.web.dev/).   
To speed up programming while ensuring beauty we utilize the [UI Kit Attractions](https://illright.github.io/attractions/?ref=madewithsvelte.com) - see also [intro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkD88ARvucM&t=492s).

If you use VS Code as IDE you might want to install the extension named "svelte for vs code".  

## Backend
When it comes to off-chain backends [Deno](https://deno.land) is the runtime environment of choice imo.    
Deno can be perceived as the successor of NodeJS imo.  
You might check the [Deno Main Repo](https://github.com/denoland/deno) and join the [Deno Community](https://discord.com/invite/deno).
