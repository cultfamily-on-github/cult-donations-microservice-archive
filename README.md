# CULT & RVLT Donations Microservice

[cultdonations.org](https://cultdonations.org) is a place where people can register their wallet address and their linkedin or facebook profile link. CULT OGs can check if the owner of the linkedin or facebook profile is actively and consistently providing education to facebook friends or linkedin contacts around the CULTDAO. If he does, chances are high that donators will donate to this wallet.

To incentivice this game for donators their donations are listed on [cultdonations.org](https://cultdonations.org) which will again inspire big wallets to donate to those who donate consistently to newcomers.

This mechanism shall rapidly increase the amount of CULT & RVLT holders and at the same time support Peer 2 Peer Education for newcomers around topics like self hostet wallets, decentralization, CULTDAO etc.

Our power is massive when we collaborate. 

In order to strengthen resilience, scalability and technological freedom for contributors, we establish a microservices architecture. 

Programmers might contribute and explore and improve architectures of freedom.

## Status
First Drafts & Idea Collection

## Frontend
When it comes to state of the art web programming frameworks [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) is the framework [of choice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv3Yq-B8qp4) imo.    
The two main reasons for that choice - comparing svelte to angular, vue and react - are performance and simplicity.   
You might continuously improve the performance of this page utilizing [pagespeed.web.dev](https://pagespeed.web.dev/).   
To speed up programming while ensuring beauty we utilize the [UI Kit Attractions](https://illright.github.io/attractions/?ref=madewithsvelte.com) - see also [intro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkD88ARvucM&t=492s).

If you use VS Code as IDE you might want to install the extension named "svelte for vs code".  

## Backend
When it comes to off-chain backends [Deno](https://deno.land) is the runtime environment of choice imo.    
Deno can be perceived as the successor of NodeJS imo.  
You might check the [Deno Main Repo](https://github.com/denoland/deno) and join the [Deno Community](https://discord.com/invite/deno).
